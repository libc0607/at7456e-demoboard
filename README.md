# at7456e-demoboard
AT7456E is a "Single-Channel Monochrome On-Screen Display with Integrated EEPROM" chip, and here's a simple Demoboard of it.    
Hardware design at [AT7456E-OSD-Demoboard_EasyEDA](https://lceda.cn/libc0607/AT7546_Demo-b08c5b9bad0b490eb6610c65c4b525c4).   
Driver is based on the codes in PDF "AT7456(E) 使用方法及注意事项,2017-03-31,徐建华".  
It will be tested with Arduino and I'm planning to use the A9G module produced by Ai-Thinker.
